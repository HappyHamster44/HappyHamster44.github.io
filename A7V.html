            The A7V was a heavy tank that Germany had during WWI. 
            There is only one surviving A7V called Mephisto on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. 
            Only ten chassis were A7Vs and the rest became Ãœberlandwagen cargo carriers. 
            They were the only tanks produced by the Germans in WWI. 
            They were also the first operational German tanks. 
            They were built to counter the British Mark V tank. 
            The A7V is roughly 31.5 tons, its length was 24ft. 1in., and it held up to 25 crew members. 
            The first prototype was completed and tested on April 30 1917and a wooden mockup was completed in May. 
            Its max speed was 9.3 mph on roads and 4 mph cross-country.

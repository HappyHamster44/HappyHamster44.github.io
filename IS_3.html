       <p>The IS-3 was another Russian heavy tank, this time with a spherical turret instead of the normal sloped turret. It was considered a wonder, with many, many false claims involving the United States and the ruler of the United Kingdom. It was developed in 1944, seeing a small amount of combat in WW2. It had 250mm armor, with a total of 400mm of effective thickness. It had a 122mm cannon, with 1 DT MG, and 1 DShK machine gun, being used as anti aircraft. It was a very good tank, being used in its time in WW2 and the Cold War.

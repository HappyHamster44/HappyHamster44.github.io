        <p>
            The M1918(Ford 3-ton tank) was one of the first tankettes. 
            The only gun on it was a Marlin machine gun off of an M1917, it was eventually changed to a M1919 Browning. 
            Its gas tank could only hold 17-US gallons of gas. 
            It had a crew of two and was built to fight alongside the Renault FT. 
            The US was going to produce 15,000 of them, however, before the orders could be fulfilled, the 1918 Armistice occurred and the orders were canceled.

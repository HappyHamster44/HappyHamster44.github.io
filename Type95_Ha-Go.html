            In the early 1930s, the Japanese army initiated experiments with a mechanized warfare unit that combined infantry and tanks, but faced challenges with the Type 89 Medium tank's speed, which lagged behind motorized infantry trucks capable of 40 km/h. 
            Tomio Hara from the Army Technical Bureau responded by developing a new light tank in 1933 that could match this speed. 
            The initial prototype completed in 1934 was heavy and underwent modifications to reduce its weight. 
            After successful testing in Manchuria, the Type 95 light tank was endorsed by 1935 for mechanized infantry, despite concerns about its armor. 
            Production spearheaded by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and various other companies began in 1936, with mass production starting in 1938. 
            The Type 95, also known as "Ha-Go", quickly became the mainstay for Japanese armored forces.

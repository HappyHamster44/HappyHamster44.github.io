        During World War II, Sweden maintained a policy of neutrality, striving to avoid direct involvement in the conflict. This stance allowed the country to escape the devastation experienced by many of its European neighbors. Despite its neutrality, Sweden faced challenges in navigating the complex geopolitical landscape of the time. The country maintained trade relations with both the Allies and the Axis powers, providing essential resources such as iron ore to Germany. Sweden also provided refuge for around 70,000 Jews, saving them from the horrors of the Holocaust. While Sweden remained unoccupied and avoided direct military conflict, the government faced scrutiny for its pragmatic approach to dealing with the warring nations. After the war, Sweden's neutral stance contributed to its post-war stability, economic growth, and the development of its welfare state.

      <p>	The KV-1 was a Russian heavy tank, seeing much combat in WW2. The KV-1 was an amazing tank, seen in one Russian story. One KV-1 intercepted 18 German Panzer 3s, and even though it was outnumbered, it took them all down one by one. The battle was proved to be accurate, and was one of the best motivators for Russian tankers. It had a 76.2mm cannon, with 5219 built. It had an astounding 110-120mm armor, however it didnâ€™t have the best rear armor. Most tanks at the time had a hard time penetrating the hull and turret of the KV-1. 
<br>The KV-1 was a heavy tank because of its 110 - 120mm thick armor all around. The backside was slightly weaker, however it was strong enough that some tanks couldn't even damage the KV-1 at all. Because of the heavy armor however, it had a mediocre speed of 35mph, still good for a heavy tank, but not as fast as other medium or light tanks at the time. The armor was pretty sloped, and sometimes bounced shells of the turret and hull. 
<br>The KV-1 had a 76.2mm cannon, which was very big. It had three or four DT machine guns, which were standard for most WW2 Russian tanks. It had enough firepower to kill most tanks, and even with some lighter vehicles it could overpressure them to the point of instant explosion. The gun could carry many different types of shells, and it could carry many of those shells at the same time. The firepower was not a problem for the KV-1
<br>There weren't really any major flaws with the KV-1, other than the transmission being below standard.
<br>The engine that the KV-1 used was a  V-2 V12 diesel engine, which is used on basically every Russian WW2 tank. The transmission was below average, making the KV-1 slightly slower than other tanks, however it was still good. The transmission had a bad habit of breaking down in combat, which either ended up with the crew surrendering, the crew abandoning the tank, or the worst outcome, the capture of the crew and the KV-1.

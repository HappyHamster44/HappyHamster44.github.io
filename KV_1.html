      <p>	The KV-1 was a Russian heavy tank, seeing much combat in WW2. The KV-1 was an amazing tank, seen in one Russian story. One KV-1 intercepted 18 German Panzer 3s, and even though it was outnumbered, it took them all down one by one. The battle was proved to be accurate, and was one of the best motivators for Russian tankers. It had a 76.2mm cannon, with 5219 built. It had an astounding 110-120mm armor, however it didnâ€™t have the best rear armor. Most tanks at the time had a hard time penetrating the hull and turret of the KV-1.

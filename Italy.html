        <p>During World War II, Italy was initially governed by Benito Mussolini's fascist regime, which aligned itself with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan as part of the Axis powers. Mussolini aimed to restore Italy to its former Roman glory and expand its territorial influence. The Italian military, however, faced numerous challenges, struggling with inadequate resources and training. The invasion of Greece in 1940 resulted in setbacks for the Italian forces and required German assistance. In 1943, as the tide of the war turned against the Axis, Italy experienced internal turmoil. Mussolini was ousted, and the new Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies, leading to a complex situation of dual occupation by both Allied and German forces. This period marked a significant turning point for Italy, as it underwent political transformations and became a battleground for the competing interests of the Allies and Axis powers.</p>

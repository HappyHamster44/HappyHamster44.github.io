        <p>The KV-2 is a Russian heavy tank, nicknamed the “Russian Refrigerator”. It was named this due to the turret being rectangular, and just looking like a refrigerator. It had an insane 152 mm cannon on its turret, and reloaded very slowly. It could take many shots from the front, however not too many from the back. It did not have the advantage of sloped armor, but it made up with that by just having thick armor on most sides. It had 6 crew, and 2 machine guns for taking care of open top vehicles, or for dealing with anti-tank infantry.
<br>The KV-2 had 60 - 110mm thick rolled homogenous armor, with a pretty goood slope on the front plate, but the turret wasn't as angled as other Russian tanks. The turret looked like a rectangle with slight slopes on the sides, earning it the nickname the Russian Refrigerator. The armor was thick enough to stop many German or Italian made shells. 
<br>The main gun on the KV-2 was 152mm, about as large as many artillery shells at the time. The gun easily killed any tank it shot, and even is able to destroy modern MBTs. It has a ton of explosive filler is basically every single type of shell it carried, making the amount of damage much higher than other shells at the time. It had up to 2 machine guns on the front, making it a very powerful tank for the time.
<br>The biggest flaw in the KV-2 was the amount of time it took to reload the main gun, taking up to 42 seconds, compared to the standard 6.2 second reload of most German, Italian, British, American, and Russian tanks at the time. 
<br>The KV-2 had the V2-K-12 engine installed on its models, having 550hp, however, it still made the KV-2 slower than a lot of the tanks at the time. It used the same transmission as the KV-1, meaning it would break down during combat, or break down during testing. The KV-2 did use a lot of resources for the engine and transmission, as they did need to carry more weight than other tanks at the time.

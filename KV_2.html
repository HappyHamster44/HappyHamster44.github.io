        <p>The KV-2 is a Russian heavy tank, nicknamed the “Russian Refrigerator”. It was named this due to the turret being rectangular, and just looking like a refrigerator. It had an insane 152 mm cannon on its turret, and reloaded very slowly. It could take many shots from the front, however not too many from the back. It did not have the advantage of sloped armor, but it made up with that by just having thick armor on most sides. It had 6 crew, and 2 machine guns for taking care of open top vehicles, or for dealing with anti-tank infantry.

            The Messerschmitt Me 163 B, nicknamed the "Komet," was a revolutionary German rocket-powered interceptor aircraft deployed during World War II. 
            As the only operational rocket-powered fighter aircraft, it was designed to defend against Allied bomber raids. 
            The Me 163 B could reach unprecedented speeds for its time, exceeding 600 mph, thanks to its Walter HWK 109-509 rocket engine. 
            However, its operational use was hampered by its limited flight endurance, dangerous volatile fuel, and lack of effective armament. 
            Despite these challenges, the Me 163 B represented a significant technological leap in aviation, influencing post-war aircraft design and the development of future high-speed military jets.

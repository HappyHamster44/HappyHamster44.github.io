        <p>The Type 63 is a Chinese amphibious light tank that was first introduced in the early 1960s. It was specifically designed to operate in marshy and watery environments, making it a valuable asset in amphibious assaults and river-crossing operations.
<br>The tank is armed with a 85mm main gun and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, which provides effective firepower against most ground targets. It also has a crew of four, including a driver, a gunner, a commander and a loader.
<br>The Type 63 is powered by a diesel engine that provides a top speed of around 50 km/h on land and 12 km/h on water. Its amphibious capabilities are due to its two water propulsion units, which allow it to operate in shallow waters and even cross rivers.
<br>Overall, the Type 63 is a versatile armored vehicle that is well-suited to amphibious operations and provides a solid combination of mobility, firepower and protection. Despite being an older design, it remains in service with the Chinese military and has been exported to a number of other countries.</p>

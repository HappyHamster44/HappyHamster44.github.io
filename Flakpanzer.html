            The 2 cm Flak 38 auf Panzer I Ausf√ºhrung A (Flakpanzer I) was developed during the Battle of France in WWII. 
            It was a rare self-propelled anti-aircraft conversion of the Panzer I. 
            They were only produced in 1941 and used from 1941 - 1943, and only 24 were ever made. 
            The Waffenamt (German Army Weapons Agency) decided to combine light anti-aircraft guns with the chassis of tanks. 
            When they were in action they were folded down and used as something to stand on. 
            They were armed with a Flak 38 AAG, and the crew were armed with Karabiner 98 k's. 
            The battalion that the Flakpanzers were in was wiped out in the Battle of Stalingrad.

        <p>The SU-85 was a SPG developed by the Soviet Union. It had very good armor, a very powerful main gun, but it did not have a 360° turret, or a turret at all. It had 15°of rotation on either side horizontally, same with vertically. . Because of the SU-85 not having a turret, it could be easily disabled by destroying the tracks. It had a frontal plate of 45mm, and had a 85mm D-5T gun. The tank was later outfitted with APDSH shell, making the tank’s gun even more powerful. The tank had an interesting turret, being a sphere instead of the regular rectangular turret that can swivel. The main reason why they made the turret into a sphere was because otherwise the recoil from the gun would pick the tank up the ground by a few feet. It was very powerful otherwise, being able to take out German or Italian tanks at incredible ranges.

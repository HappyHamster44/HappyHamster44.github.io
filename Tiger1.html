            The Tiger I was a German heavy tank used in World War II, entering service in 1942 in Africa and the Soviet Union, often in independent heavy tank battalions. 
            It was the first German tank to mount the powerful 8.8 cm KwK 36 gun, with 1,347 units built between 1942 and 1944 before production shifted to the Tiger II. 
            While praised for its advanced design, the Tiger I was also criticized for being overengineered and expensive to produce and maintain. 
            It was prone to track failures and difficult to transport in harsh conditions. 
            Named by Ferdinand Porsche and later re-designated PzKpfw VI Ausf. E, only nine Tiger I tanks survive today, with the UK's Tank Museum housing the only operational example, Tiger 131.

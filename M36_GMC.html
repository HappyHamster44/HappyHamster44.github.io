        <p>The M36 was an American tank destroyer used during World War II and the Korean War. It was developed in response to the need for a more powerful tank destroyer that could handle the heavy armor used by German tanks.
<br>The M36 was based on the chassis of the M10 tank destroyer, but was modified to accommodate a more powerful 90mm gun. The gun was capable of penetrating the armor of most German tanks, making the M36 a formidable opponent on the battlefield.
<br>The M36 first saw combat in Europe during World War II, where it was used to support Allied units and provide anti-tank defense. It also saw action in the Pacific theater and was used extensively during the Korean War.
<br>One of the most notable engagements involving the M36 was the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. During the battle, a small group of M36 tank destroyers held off a much larger force of German tanks and infantry, helping to turn the tide of the battle in favor of the Allies.
<br>Although the M36 was eventually replaced by more advanced tank destroyers, it played an important role in the Allied victory in World War II and in the defense of South Korea during the Korean War. Its powerful gun and mobility made it a valuable asset on the battlefield, and its use helped to reduce the effectiveness of enemy armored forces.The M10 was an American tank destroyer used during World War II. It was developed in response to the German army's use of heavily armored tanks, which were difficult to destroy with existing American tanks. The M10 was armed with a powerful 3-inch (76 mm) gun, which was capable of penetrating the armor of most German tanks at the time.

          <p>The M11/39 was a tank with 2 turrets. It had 30mm armor, but is mainly immune to machine gun fire on the front. It can move fast, but not enough to outpace many enemy vehicles. It has a 37mm cannon that is mostly unimpressive. It can puncture armor at close range. It also has a twin 8mm Breda Mod. It can be used against aircraft, but can't really puncture armor. It was originally ment to be a standard medium tank. However, the positioning of the turrets didn't work well. Unlike other tanks, the machine guns were put on the rotating turrets while the main gun was in a semi-fixed position. There were no radios, which was a disadvantage. Only 100 were made.

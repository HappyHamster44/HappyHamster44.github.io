        <p>The P 26/40 was a heavy/medium tank used in WW2. It had a 75mm gun and an 8mm Breda machine gun, and a machine gun in the AA (Anti-Aircraft) mount. In 1940, the development started. About 5 were made by 1943, at which point Germany took over. Some were used in combat, and some as static strongpoints. They were used to defend Rome in the armistice. In 1945, several were lost to American Shermans. </p>

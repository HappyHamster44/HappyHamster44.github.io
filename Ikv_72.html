            In early 1949, the Swedish Army launched a project to develop an assault gun, the Ikv 72, designed to provide direct fire support for infantry and replace towed artillery. 
            The requirements included a cost-effective, small, and lightweight vehicle not exceeding 6 tons. 
            By 1952, Landsverk joined the project, and from 1953 to 1954, 36 Ikv 72s were delivered. 
            The vehicle featured a casemate design with an open-top superstructure, rear-placed drive wheels, and an 8-ton weight. 
            Originally intended to mount a 105 mm gun, the Ikv 72 was temporarily equipped with a 75 mm m/41 gun from the Stridsvagn m/42, due to the unavailability of the 105 mm gun, and it fired high explosive shells.

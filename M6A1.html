        <p>
            The American M6A1 heavy tank was built during World War II. 
            It had a big 76mm gun and a 37mm gun, along with several machine guns. 
            Even though it had strong armor, the tank was very heavy and hard to move around. 
            Because of this, only a few were made, and they didnâ€™t get used in battles. 
            Instead, the U.S. decided to focus on the lighter and easier-to-use M4 Sherman tank.

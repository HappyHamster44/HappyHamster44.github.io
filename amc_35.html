        The AMC 35 was a French medium tank that was used during the early stages of World War II. It was designed and produced by the Atelier de Construction de Rueil (AMX) between 1936 and 1940. The tank was armed with a 47mm SA35 gun and had a crew of three. It weighed around 19 tons and had a top speed of 28 km/h.
<br>The AMC 35 was used extensively during the Battle of France in 1940, where it proved to be a capable tank in the early stages of the campaign. However, it was quickly outclassed by German tanks such as the Panzer III and IV, which had thicker armor and better armament. Despite this, the AMC 35 continued to see use in the French Army until the end of the war, albeit in limited numbers.
<br>Overall, the AMC 35 was an important tank in the early stages of World War II, but was ultimately outmatched by more advanced German tanks. Its legacy, however, lives on as a testament to the skill and ingenuity of French tank designers during this period.

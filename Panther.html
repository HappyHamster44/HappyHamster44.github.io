            The Panzerkampfwagen V Panther (Panther) was a medium tank built during WWII. 
            The Panther was used on the Eastern and Western fronts from mid-1943 to the end of the war in 1945. 
            The Panther was made to counter the Sovietâ€™s T-34. 
            It had better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rougher terrain then the Tiger I. 
            The Panther did have weaker side armor which was a downside but it still worked very well. 
            Roughly 6,000 of then were built. 
            One Panther cost roughly 117,100 Reichsmarks to produce and the tonnage was about 45 tonnes.

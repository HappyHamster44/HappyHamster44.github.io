            The German SA 313B Alouette II is a cool, small helicopter that was made in the early 1960s. 
            It was built by a company called BÃ¶lkow and is based on a French helicopter design. 
            This chopper is known for being super versatile and reliable. 
            It has one big rotor on top and uses skids for landing instead of wheels. 
            The SA 313B could be used for all sorts of jobs, like spying or rescue missions. 
            Its small size and easy handling made it really useful and helped shape the way light helicopters are designed today. 
            Although it's not as widely used anymore, it was an important step in the development of modern helicopters. 
            Its design inspired many future aircraft with its innovative features.

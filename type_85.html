        <p>The Type 85 tank is a Chinese main battle tank that was first introduced in the early 1990s. It is an upgraded version of the Type 80 tank and is designed and manufactured by the China North Industries Corporation (Norinco). 
<br>The Type 85 tank features a number of advanced technologies, such as a composite armor system that provides superior protection against enemy fire. The tank is powered by a diesel engine that produces 730 horsepower, giving it a top speed of 60 km/h and a range of up to 500 km. 
<br>The Type 85 tank is armed with a 125mm smoothbore gun that can fire a range of ammunition, including armor-piercing rounds, high-explosive rounds, and anti-tank guided missiles. The tank also features a 12.7mm heavy machine gun and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun for additional firepower. 
<br>The Type 85 tank has undergone a number of upgrades since its introduction, including the addition of a new fire control system, improved engines, and enhanced armor. It has also been exported to a number of countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sudan. 
<br>Overall, the Type 85 tank is a capable and reliable main battle tank that has served the Chinese military well for many years. While it may not be as advanced as some of its Western counterparts, it offers a cost-effective solution for countries looking to upgrade their armored capabilities.

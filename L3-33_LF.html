           <p>The L3/33 Lf was a variant of the L3/33 that had a flamethrower nozzle instead of a machine gun. It carried a 110 gallon oil tank behind. It had a range of 40 to 100 meters. The LF in the name stands for Lancia fiamme, which means flamethrower. In later versions, the oil tank was carried above the engine compartment. </p>

        <p>The ZSU-37 was a Soviet SPAAG, with only 385 being produced. It was mostly experimental, with it only being briefly used in 1945. It was later updated to the ZSU-37-2 being mass produced 1957 - 1960. It had a 6-man crew, more than the standard 4-man crew, making it more survivable. It was barely used in WW2, but since it was produced in WW2, I will include it. In WW2, the main version, (ZSU-37), was barely used in WW2, however, it was used later in the ZSU-37-2. The ZSU-37 barely saw combat, as with the ZSU-37-2, as it was very poor at dealing with fast, low-flying targets. Because of this, you will not hear much about the ZSU-37 or the ZSU-37-2. They barely saw combat, and most reports on them are biased. It was not effective even in the later version, the ZSU-57-2. The ZSU family mostly saw combat in the 6-day war.

       <p>The BT-6 was a Russian light tank, remembered for its incredible speed and agility. However, the speed of the BT-6 had some downsides. Due to the expectations of the Russian higher-ups, they wanted this tank to be able to get behind enemy lines, scout, or be able to get out of a tough spot with ease. The main downside with the BT-6 was the amount of armor it had on its front plate and turret. The hull’s thickness ranged anywhere between 6-40mm, with the turret being at 10-15mm. The gun the BT-6 had on it was a 45mm gun, being able to reliably penetrate 35mm of armor. The back side of the BT-6 could be damaged by infantry fire, resulting in the engine being damaged or exploding. The special thing on the BT-6 was the fact that it could drive with no tracks on roads, however the chain drive did not work very well on rough, uneven terrain. The BT-6 did have a machine gun to deal with infantry, but sometimes when there was a shortage of 45mm or 37mm guns, the BT-6 was fitted with 3 machine guns. The BT-6 was a very good tank overall, being able to complete most missions with ease. 
<br>The BT-6 had 20mm armor, being heavily sloped, and was quite strong for a light tank. It could easily deflect oncoming shells, making the BT-6 very strong in combat. It had enough armor to stop oncoming shells, but not so much where the BT, standing for Быстроходный танк/БТ, or very fast tank in english. It's safe to say that the BT-6 was no tank to look down on, being used through 1932 to 1941. It saw combat in many situations, making it a very good tank.
<br>The BT-6 had a 45mm main gun on most models, some fitted with 37mm guns when they had no 45mm guns left, then after all other guns were out, they could still fit 3 machine guns on the turret of the tank, making it into a versatile tank. It had 2 7.62mm DT machine guns on all models. It was very powerful, and could take out many German and most Italian tanks with relative ease. 
<br>The BT-6 had not as many flaws as other Russian tanks, however it absolutely did have a few major ones. It used a lot of fuel,  and needed insane amounts of maintenance for it to still be usable. Because of the amount of gas the BT-6 took, it was not used in later stages of WW2. Another problem with the BT-6 was the 37mm gun lacking armor. Like most Russian tanks, the area around the cannon breech was easy for enemy German or Italian tanks to shoot through, but it still was powerful enough for the time, and most Russian tanks did have that flaw. It had little flaws, however the few that were there were pretty noticeable. 
<br>The BT-6 had a M-5-400 engine, a pretty powerful engine for the time. It was supposed to be able to go to an insane 1-5 kilometers an hour, however there were a few flaws that made the BT-6 max speed be at 78 - 81 kilometers an hour. Most of the time the engine and transmission of the BT-6 was pretty good, however it was decreased when in mud or sandy terrain. It still had a lot of power, and easily went through many rough terrains.

       <p>The BT-6 was a Russian light tank, remembered for its incredible speed and agility. However, the speed of the BT-6 had some downsides. Due to the expectations of the Russian higher-ups, they wanted this tank to be able to get behind enemy lines, scout, or be able to get out of a tough spot with ease. The main downside with the BT-6 was the amount of armor it had on its front plate and turret. The hullâ€™s thickness ranged anywhere between 6-40mm, with the turret being at 10-15mm. The gun the BT-6 had on it was a 45mm gun, being able to reliably penetrate 35mm of armor. The back side of the BT-6 could be damaged by infantry fire, resulting in the engine being damaged or exploding. The special thing on the BT-6 was the fact that it could drive with no tracks on roads, however the chain drive did not work very well on rough, uneven terrain. The BT-6 did have a machine gun to deal with infantry, but sometimes when there was a shortage of 45mm or 37mm guns, the BT-6 was fitted with 3 machine guns. The BT-6 was a very good tank overall, being able to complete most missions with ease.

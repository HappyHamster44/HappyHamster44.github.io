            The Panzerjager Tiger Ausf. B (Jagdtiger) was a heavy tank destroyer produced from 1944 -1945 during WWII. 
            80 Jagdtiger were produced although they ordered 150. 
            They were armed with 12.8cm Pak 44 L/55 guns. 
            Only 2 heavy anti-tank battalions, 512th & 653rd, were equiped with Jagdtigers. 
            They had the same engine as the already underpowered Tiger I + Tiger II. 
            The crew for the Jagdtigers were very poorly trained. 
            At one point one of the tank was shot by a friendly tank because they had never seen a Jagdtiger before and mistook it for a enemy.

            The American AH-1G Cobra was one of the first attack helicopters used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. 
            It was built to be fast and agile, with a slim design that made it harder for enemies to target. 
            The AH-1G could carry powerful weapons like rockets, machine guns, and grenade launchers, which made it great for providing support to ground troops. 
            It was also able to fly low and fast, helping it avoid enemy fire while still delivering accurate strikes. 
            This helicopter played a big role in helping soldiers during battles by providing quick and powerful air support.
